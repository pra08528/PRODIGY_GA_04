**DESCRIPION : Generative AI Project**

*Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN*

Develop an image-to-image translation model based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) architecture, specifically using the pix2pix framework. The goal is to train a model that can convert images from one domain to another, given a paired dataset of input and target images.
